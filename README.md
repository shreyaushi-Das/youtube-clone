# YouTube Landing Page Clone (HTML + CSS)

A responsive frontend clone of YouTube’s landing page — built using **pure HTML & CSS** to strengthen my fundamentals.

## 🚀 Purpose

Wanted to test how well I actually understand layouts *without touching any frameworks*.  
This mini-project is part of my **foundation-building era**, focusing on:

- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Relative vs absolute positioning
- Responsive design basics

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- HTML5
- CSS3
- 💯 No JavaScript, no Bootstrap, just raw code

## 💡 What I Learned / Faced

- Flexbox sometimes just… *doesn’t flex* unless you force it 😭
- Grid layouts are powerful but confusing (still beefing with `fr` units)
- `position:absolute` went rogue more than once
- Getting elements to align *exactly like YouTube* → harder than expected

## 🛠️ How to Run Locally

```bash
git clone "url"
cd youtube-clone
open index.html     # OR simply double-click the file
